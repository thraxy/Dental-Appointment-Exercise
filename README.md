# Dental-Appointment-Exercise

There should be appointments already created and you are simply asking the users for a date to check against them.

Write a method OccursOn inside each of the sub classes that checks whether the appointment occurs on that date (OneTime), day (Day) or month (Month). Ask the user to enter a date to check (for example, 2006 10 5), and ask to user if they want to check against OneTime, Day or Month appointment. Based on what the user selected, OccursOn inside each of the sub class should run and display any matching appointment and associated descriptions.

For OneTime subclass, OccursOn need three inputs (Year, Month and Day) to validate, for Day subclass, OccursOn needs one input (Day) to validate, and for Month subclass, OccursOn need one input (Month) to validate. OccursOn is different for different subclasses.
